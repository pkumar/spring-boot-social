# spring-boot-social
Twitter's Favorites have several uses, however I mostly use it as a social bookmark for later revisit. 

## About the app
A sample spring-boot app using using spring- mvc/social library to retrieve the favorites of a twitter handle. 

## Working demo of the app:
https://afternoon-peak-3750.herokuapp.com/welcome - Change the twitter handle to your preferred. 

## Running the app 
1. Import the app in Spring Tool Suite https://spring.io/tools/sts/all  (as running Spring-boot app is pre-enabled in STS) 
2. To get this app up and running, you will have to first signup for a Twitter Dev API key https://twittercommunity.com/t/how-to-get-my-api-key/7033 
2. Once you have the API key/secret, create an application.properties (copy/paste application-template.properties and rename it) file under src/main/resource https://github.com/pkumar/spring-boot-social/tree/master/src/main/resources 
3. Run the app as a "Spring Boot" app via STS. 
4. Once the embedded tomcat is up, hit http://localhost:8080/welcome
